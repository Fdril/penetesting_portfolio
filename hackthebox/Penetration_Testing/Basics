ðŸ”¹ Basics to Advanced Penetration Testing
Penetration testing (or ethical hacking) involves simulating cyberattacks to identify vulnerabilities in systems before malicious hackers exploit them. The process typically follows these stages:

Reconnaissance â€“ Gathering information about the target.

Scanning & Enumeration â€“ Identifying open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.

Exploitation â€“ Gaining unauthorized access using discovered vulnerabilities.

Post-Exploitation â€“ Maintaining access and escalating privileges.

Reporting & Remediation â€“ Documenting findings and suggesting fixes.

HackTheBox Academy and TryHackMe2 offer hands-on labs covering these phases, helping learners build practical expertise.

ðŸ”¹ Roles & Teams in Penetration Testing
Penetration testers work with various teams in cybersecurity:

Red Team â€“ Offensive security professionals who simulate real-world attacks.

Blue Team â€“ Defensive security experts who protect systems from attacks.

Purple Team â€“ A collaboration between Red and Blue teams to improve security.

Security Operations Center (SOC) â€“ Monitors and responds to security incidents.

ðŸ”¹ Job Titles & Responsibilities
Penetration testers can hold different job titles, including:

Penetration Tester â€“ Conducts security assessments and ethical hacking.

Security Consultant â€“ Advises organizations on security improvements.

Red Team Operator â€“ Simulates advanced cyberattacks.

Bug Bounty Hunter â€“ Finds vulnerabilities in applications for rewards.

Cybersecurity Analyst â€“ Monitors threats and mitigates risks.

ðŸ”¹ Career Path in Penetration Testing
A typical career progression:

Beginner â€“ Learn networking, Linux, and basic security concepts.

Intermediate â€“ Gain hands-on experience with penetration testing tools.

Advanced â€“ Specialize in areas like web application security, exploit development, or cloud security.

Expert â€“ Lead security assessments, conduct red teaming, or research vulnerabilities.

Certifications like OSCP, CEH, PNPT, and HTB Certified Penetration Tester help validate skills.

Wireshark â€“ Network traffic analysis.

John the Ripper & Hashcat â€“ Password cracking.

Gobuster & Dirb â€“ Directory enumeration.

SQLmap â€“ Automated SQL injection testing.

ðŸ”¹ Key Skills for Penetration Testers
To excel in penetration testing, you need:

Networking & System Administration â€“ Understanding protocols, firewalls, and OS internals.

Scripting & Programming â€“ Python, Bash, and PowerShell for automation.

Web Security â€“ OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques.

Active Directory & Cloud Security â€“ Enterprise security assessments.

Report Writing & Communication â€“ Documenting findings professionally.

HackTheBox Academy and TryHackMe2 provide structured learning paths to develop these skills, preparing learners for real-world penetration testing roles.
