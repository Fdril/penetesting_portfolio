# üîê Secure Shell (SSH) ‚Äì Overview & Practical Use  

## What is SSH?  
Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol that enables secure remote access, file transfers, and tunneling over unsecured networks. By default, SSH operates on **port 22**, providing system administrators and security professionals a reliable way to connect to remote systems.  

## Authentication Methods  
SSH can be configured with two primary authentication mechanisms:  
- **Password Authentication** ‚Äì Requires user credentials for access.  
- **Public-Key Authentication** ‚Äì Uses an SSH key pair (private & public) for passwordless login, enhancing security.  

## Practical Uses of SSH  
SSH is widely used for:  
- **Remote system administration** ‚Äì Securely managing servers.  
- **Network tunneling & port forwarding** ‚Äì Connecting to internal resources.  
- **Secure file transfer** ‚Äì Uploading and downloading files (via SCP/SFTP).  
- **Accessing remote machines** ‚Äì Enabling secure connections across networks or over the internet.  

## SSH Client-Server Model  
An SSH session involves an SSH **client** (e.g., OpenSSH) initiating a connection to an SSH **server**, enabling remote access to execute commands or transfer files securely.  

### **Using SSH for Remote Access**  
When penetration testers or ethical hackers obtain valid credentials‚Äîeither cleartext passwords or private SSH keys‚Äîthey can use SSH to connect to a system securely.  

Example command:  
```bash
ssh username@remote-server-ip
```
Example login process:  
```bash
DamiL@htb:~$ ssh Bob@10.10.10.10  
Bob@remotehost's password: *********  
Bob@remotehost:~$  
```
Once inside, the user can interact with the system, navigate directories, transfer files, or perform security assessments.  

## **SSH in Penetration Testing**  
SSH is a stable and reliable method of remote access, often preferred over reverse shells in security assessments. Some common penetration testing scenarios involving SSH include:  
- **Credential access** ‚Äì Using obtained credentials to log in via SSH.  
- **Jump host usage** ‚Äì Establishing SSH access on a compromised machine to pivot to other hosts in a network.  
- **Port forwarding** ‚Äì Mapping local ports to remote hosts for access to internal systems.  
- **Persistence setup** ‚Äì Adding an SSH public key for persistent access to a compromised system.  

### **Mapping Local Ports via SSH**  
SSH provides an effective way to forward ports from a remote system to a local machine:  
```bash
ssh -L local-port:remote-host:remote-port username@remote-server  
```
This technique is invaluable when accessing restricted services behind firewalls or proxies.  

## **Conclusion**  
SSH is an essential tool for secure remote access, system administration, and penetration testing. Whether used to connect to a machine, transfer files, or create tunnels within networks, its reliability makes it a preferred choice among security professionals.
