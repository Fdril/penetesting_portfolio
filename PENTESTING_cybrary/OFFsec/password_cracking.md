# OFFENSIVE SECURITY
## PASSWORD CRACKING LAB
I am with a cracking list of passwords that you previously exfiltrated from a vulnerable web application. The vulnerable application was successfully exploited, resulting in leaked passwords that require cleartext (or cracked) values. Once acquired, you can use them to extend your attacks against the system or even pivot within the internal network to another system. The goal of this exercise is to identify the password hashing algorithm and attempt to crack the password.

## using a cloud based Ubuntu lab on cybrary

## STEP 1 
👍 Navigate to the Terminal of the cloud based ubuntu lab\
👍 then ➡️  enter the ls command to list all the file in the dir.\
👍 then ➡️ navigate to the documents dir to find the list\
👍 the list is a hash list which is saved as hash.txt

👍 open the list with\
``` cat hash.txt```  command.\

The output of this command looks like it's a bunch of random letters and numbers, but it's far from random. It actually a hash that was created by running a word through a hashing algorithm.
