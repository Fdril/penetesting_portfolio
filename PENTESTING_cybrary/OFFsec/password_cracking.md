# OFFENSIVE SECURITY
## PASSWORD CRACKING LAB
I am with a cracking list of passwords that you previously exfiltrated from a vulnerable web application. The vulnerable application was successfully exploited, resulting in leaked passwords that require cleartext (or cracked) values. Once acquired, you can use them to extend your attacks against the system or even pivot within the internal network to another system. The goal of this exercise is to identify the password hashing algorithm and attempt to crack the password.

## using a cloud based Ubuntu lab on cybrary

## STEP 1 - LEt's hunt  

üëç Navigate to the Terminal of the cloud based ubuntu lab\
üëç then ‚û°Ô∏è  enter the ls command to list all the file in the dir.\
üëç then ‚û°Ô∏è navigate to the documents dir to find the list\
üëç the list is a hash list which is saved as hash.txt

üëç open the list with\
``` cat hash.txt```  command.\

The output of this command looks like it's a bunch of random letters and numbers, but it's far from random. It actually a hash that was created by running a word through a hashing algorithm.   
:accessibility: so , now we will have to determine what type of hash_algorithm is in use before we can know how to dehash it.  

## STEP 2 - Let's Discover the hash algorithm
### HASH SPECIFICATION
 in the same terminal and the same dir , we will have to input this commmand to specify the hash-algorithm  
 ``` cat hash.txt | python3 hash-id.py ```

 so now we know that the hash-algorithm used is a MD5 and domain algorithm.

 


## STEP 3 - Let's crack
 üëç : ATTEMPT TO CRACK THE HASHED PASSWORD USING JOHN-THE-RIPPER.
--- open another tab or either in the same tab but it must be in the dir. where we have the --wordlist to use to for john-the-ripper to hack. or we can mention the path in the john-the-ripper command.  

``` john-the-ripper --format=raw-md5 hash.txt --wordlist=darkweb2017-top10000.txt ```

<img width="737" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f050ac7d-3565-4b3e-9877-74d5f71e2572" />


this is the command to execute john to crack the hash.txt password file.

#### --format (This is the format of the hash you identified with hash-identifier)  
#### --wordlist (This is the wordlist or dictionary that we are using to crack the hash)  
#### the wordlist is = darkweb2017-top10000.txt  
#### the formst is = raw-md5

John the Ripper will compare our hash with a wordlist made up of several known hashes and their original text. If our hash is in the wordlist we selected, when John the Ripper finishes running,
