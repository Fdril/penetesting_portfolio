Engineering and Operations is all about building and maintaining secure information systems.

Security Engineers are security-minded architects and builders. They are responsible for planning and implementing security controls throughout an IT environment. As skilled security experts, they will also commonly play a cross-functional role that assists the Defensive, Offensive, and GRC functions.
### ROLE and Responsibility for Security Engineer and Auditor.
1. planning and implementing security controls for your employer.

 ## TASK -  For this scenario, you have given the IT team the security requirements for an Apache Web Server. The IT Team has completed the build, and now it's your job to ensure all security protocols were implemented before the web server is placed into production.

## TASK 1.
#### The first thing we want to ensure is that Apache is up to date. and we are to assume that the apache is up to date if it is running on 
``` sudo apachectl -V | grep "version" ```\

## Task 2.
```sudo grep -A4 "var/www/" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf```\

This command will look for the part of the Apache configuration file that enables or disables directory listing. If you see the keyword Indexes, then directory listing is enabled. If you see -Indexes (note the minus sign), then directory listing is disabled. A secure web server should disable directory listing.

## Task 3.
```curl -s -k -i https://localhost | grep "Server"```
-s	Silent mode: hides the progress bar and error messages (makes output cleaner).\
-k	Ignores SSL certificate warnings (useful when working with self-signed certs on https://localhost).\
-i	Includes the HTTP response headers in the output.\

If you see the Apache server version, then this security requirement is not met. A secure web server should not easily reveal its version information to attackers.
