A switch or Ethernet switch. This is a device that connects nodes (computers) on the same network. So, unlike a router, a switch is only concerned about sending traffic between computers on the same network, rather than routing data between networks.

You might encounter a switch at your office, where multiple computers on your LAN (Local Area Network) are connected via cables into a switch. You may not see the switch near your desk, as it may be located in a special room within your building, where network administrators can access it.

A similar device is a hub. A hub also sends data between nodes on the same network, but the difference is that it broadcasts data to all nodes and is not smart enough to send only certain data to a certain node. Because switches can be used to send data to specific nodes, you may find that your office network only uses switches and does not have a hub.

Hubs are effectively obsolete at this point, they are still useful as a point of comparison when learning the fundamentals of networking.

A few other items on a network that you need to know about are servers, firewalls, and endpoints. We'll start with endpoints, as we actually already mentioned them above.

Endpoints are typically those things that end-users interact with, such as desktops, laptops, mobile phones, and so forth. That's sort of where the data ends as it goes out of a network, to a human, and back again.

Then you have servers. These are simply computers that provide a particular service. Examples are web servers, email servers, print servers, and so forth. You can think of them as providing services that everyone needs (i.e., everyone needs to send email; everyone needs to print files, and so forth).

firewalls are important devices in a network that filter traffic going between networks for the purposes of protecting the network. Typically, we think of the firewall as being something that protects us from bad things coming in from the internet, such as spam, viruses, and so forth.\

Hub - According to TechTarget, a network hub is "a node that broadcasts data to every computer or Ethernet-based device connected to it." Remember that unlike a switch, a hub broadcasts to all nodes and cannot direct traffic to specific nodes.\
Switch - A device that connects multiple nodes on the same network. Remember that it is more sophisticated than a hub because it can direct traffic to only certain nodes instead of broadcasting to all nodes.\
Router - A device that connects and routes traffic between networks\
Endpoint - Typically, an end-user device like a desktop, laptop, printer, mobile phone, etc.\
Server - A computer that is dedicated to providing a particular service, like a mail server or print server.\
Firewall - A device that filters traffic going between networks for the purposes of protecting the network.
