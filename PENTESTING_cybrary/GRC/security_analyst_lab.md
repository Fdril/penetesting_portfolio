## Risk Analysis

Cyber Risk Managers/Analysts or Auditors will often conduct a quantitative Cyber Risk Analysis that assigns factual data and monetary terms to express the level of risk and loss that may happen if safeguards are not in place. In the exercise below, you will practice performing a Cyber Risk Analysis.

### First, some key terms you will use in your analysis:
1. Asset Value (AV) - The monetary value an asset is worth.
2. Exposure Factor (EF) - The percentage of the assets value that would be lost if a breach or attack happened.
3. Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) - The loss from a single incident. (AV x EF)
4. Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO) - The number of times an incident is expected to occur in a year.
5. Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE) - The loss that is expected to happen within a year. (SLE x ARO)
6. Safeguard Value (SV) - The cost of a control that will be used to mitigate risk. SV is (ALE before implementing safeguard) - (ALE after implementing safeguard) - (Annual cost of safeguard) = Value of safeguard to company.
